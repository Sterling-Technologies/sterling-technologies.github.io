      <h3>Server Architectures</h3>
      <p>
        There most likely isn’t a could service we haven’t touched. We know which ones are the most affordable and which ones perform the best. We often use multiple cloud services in order to get the best results.

            Developing custom apps usually yields bugs and issues. For a time, we were also no different than other companies in this regard. Today, we rely on both manual quality assurance and automated testing to measure the stability of our applications. We take automated testing to a different level of coverage.
